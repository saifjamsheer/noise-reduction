### Speckle Noise Reduction in Medical & Satellite Imagery

Using a sliding window approach, the following linear and non-linear noise-reduction algorithms were implemented:
* Mean filtering 
* Median filtering
* Sharpening
* Unsharp masking
* Gaussian filtering
* Alpha-trimmed mean filtering 
* Adaptive weighted median filtering
* Truncated median filtering
* Morphological reconstruction
* Kuwahara filtering

At the moment, I am trying to design a noise-reduction filter that improves upon the adaptive weighted median filter and the kuwahara filter.
