### Speckle Noise Reduction in Medical Imagery & Subsequent Edge Detection

This project was created to investigate noise-reduction algorithms for a future project that involves building a deep learning model to detect diseases in medical imagery. Using a sliding window approach, the following linear and non-linear noise-reduction algorithms were implemented and compared:
* Mean filtering (fmean)
* Median filtering (fmedian)
* Sharpening (fsharpen)
* Unsharp masking (funsharp)
* Gaussian filtering (fgaussian)
* Alpha-trimmed mean filtering (ftrimmed)
* Adaptive weighted median filtering (fadaptive)
* Truncated median filtering (ftruncated)
* Morphological reconstruction (fmorph)
* Kuwahara filtering (fkuwahara)
