### Speckle Noise Reduction in Medical Imagery & Subsequent Edge Detection

This project was created to investigate noise-reduction algorithms for a future project that involves building a deep learning model to detect diseases in medical imagery. Using a sliding window approach, the following linear and non-linear noise-reduction algorithms were implemented and compared:
* Mean filtering 
* Median filtering
* Sharpening
* Unsharp masking
* Gaussian filtering
* Alpha-trimmed mean filtering 
* Adaptive weighted median filtering
* Truncated median filtering
* Morphological reconstruction
* Kuwahara filtering
