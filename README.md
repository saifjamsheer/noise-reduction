### Speckle Noise Reduction in Medical & Satellite Imagery

Using a sliding window approach, the following linear and non-linear noise-reduction filters were  implemented:
* Mean filter
* Median filter
* Sharpening filter
* Unsharp masking filter
* Gaussian filter
* Alpha-trimmed mean filter
* Adaptive weighted median filter
* Truncated median filter
* Morphological reconstruction
* Kuwahara filter
